# Kevin's Guides
## By: Kevin Olson
This project was created to demonstrate how to make a
content plugin in Joomla 4.

If you found this plugin or the guide useful, please consider leaving me a tip on the site. I'm very much a broke student operating Kevin's Guides on a $500+ yearly deficit.

It's a simple plugin that adds a {card}{/card} shortcode to articles. It puts what's in between the codes into Bootstrap cards.

The {card} shortcode has a title attribute if you want to set the card title. So {card title="my title"} would produce a card with a title.
